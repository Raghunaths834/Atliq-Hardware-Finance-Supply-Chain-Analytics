Welcome to the Atliq Hardware Analytics Project! This project is designed to transform Atliq Hardware’s operational landscape by establishing a robust framework for generating actionable insights. The insights are derived from a comprehensive analysis of key data sources, including customer behavior, transaction history, product trends, and regional dynamics.

By harnessing the power of data-driven insights, Atliq Hardware aims to revolutionize its decision-making process. These insights not only identify emerging patterns and trends but also empower the company to make strategic moves aligned with market demands and consumer preferences. This data-centric strategy forms a virtuous cycle, ensuring decisions are grounded in empirical evidence, minimizing risks, and maximizing opportunities.

**Atliq Business Model**


Atliq operates in the hardware industry, selling gadgets to various customers like Croma, BestBuy, Amazon, Staples, Flipkart, etc. Customers, in this context, refer to direct customers of Atliq, while consumers are the end users who consume the products. Atliq has a manufacturing unit and distributes its hardware gadgets to different customers across various countries. The company utilizes two types of platforms and three channels (Retailer, Direct, Distributors) for product sales.

*Croma offers promotional discounts to consumers, facilitated by Atliq.

*Various post-invoice deductions, such as festival sales discounts, platform fees, and performance rebates, are applied to the Net Invoice Sales.

*The final Net Sales are obtained by deducting the post-invoice deduction amount from Net Invoice Sales.

*The Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), including manufacturing cost, freight cost, and other expenses, is deducted from Net Sales to calculate Gross Margin.

*Atliq's profit margin is determined as a percentage of Net Sales.
